# Forward? Error? Correction?
So I absolutely *dunked* on datagrams in the [last blog post](/blog/never-use-datagrams).
Now it's time to dunk on the last remaining hope for datagrams: [Forward Error Correction](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/forward-error-correction) (FEC).

## OPUS
[Opus](https://opus-codec.org/) is an amazing audio codec.
Full disclosure, I haven't had the opportunity to work with it directly;
I was stuck in [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) land at Twitch.
But that's not going to stop me from talking out of my ass.

I want to rant about OPUS' built-in support for FEC.
And to be clear, this isn't a rant specific to OPUS.
Somebody *inevitably* asks for FEC in every networking protocol (like [MoQ](https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport/issues/320)) and you can link them this post now.

The general idea behind FEC is is to send redundant data so the receiver can paper over small amounts of packet loss.
It's conceptually similar to [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) but for packets spread over time instead of hard drives.
There are so many possible FEC schemes, many of which are patented, and I would do the subject a disservice if I even understood them.

Conveniently, audio "frames" are so small that they fit into a single datagram.
So rather than deal with retransmissions at the *disgusting* transport layer, the audio encoder can just encode redundancy via FEC.
🪦 RIP packet loss: 1983-2024 🪦

But despite being a great idea on paper, there's *so* many things wrong with this.

## Networks are Complicated
I worked with some very smart people at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/).
However, I will never forget a presentation maybe 4 years ago where a very smart codec engineer pitched using FEC.

There was a graph that showed the TCP throughput during random packet loss.
Wow, TCP sure has a low bitrate at 30% packet loss, it sucks!
But look at this other green line!
It's a custom protocol using UDP+FEC and it's multiple times faster than TCP!

If somebody shows you any results based on simulated, random packet loss, you should politely tell them: **no, that's not how the internet works**.

Networking is not quantum mechanics.
There are no dice involved and packet loss is *not random*.
It depends on the underlying transport.

- Sometimes it occurs randomly due to signal interference.
- Sometimes it occurs in bursts due to batching.
- Sometimes it occurs due to congestion.
- Sometimes it occurs because ???

Unfortunately, there's no magic loophole on the internet.
There's no one trick that has eluded TCP for 40 years, and yet the UDP geniuses have figured it out.
You can't send 10x the data to mask packet loss.

In fact, if you ever see a number like 30% packet loss in the real world (yikes), it's likely due to congestion.
You're sending 30% *too much* and fully saturating a link.
The solution is to send *less data*, not parity bits. 🤯

**Fun-fact**: That's the fundamental difference between loss-based congestion control (ex. Reno, CUBIC) and delay-based congestion control (ex. BBR, COPA).
BBRv1 doesn't even use packet loss as a signal; it's all about RTT.

## Expertise
These packet loss misconceptions come up surprisingly often in the live video space.
The hyperfocus on packet loss is a symptom of a larger problem: media experts suddenly have to become networking experts.

Even modern media protocols are built directly on top of UDP; for example [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), [SRT](https://www.haivision.com/products/srt-secure-reliable-transport/), [Sye](https://nscreenmedia.com/amazon-buys-sye/), [RIST](https://www.rist.tv/).
And for good reason, as the head-of-line blocking of TCP is a non-starter for real-time media.
But with great power (UDP) comes great responsibility.

And the same mistakes keep getting repeated.
I can't tell you the number of times I've talked to an engineer at a video conference who decries congestion control, and in the next breath claims FEC is the solution to all their problems.
Frankly, I'm just jaded at this point.

But it is definitely possible to have both media and networking expertise.
The Google engineers who built WebRTC are a testament to that.
However, the complexity of WebRTC speaks volumes to the difficulty of the task.

This is one of the many reasons why we need **Media over QUIC**.
Let the network engineers handle the network and the media engineers handle the media.

## End-to-End
But my beef with FEC in OPUS is more fundamental.

When I speak into a microphone, the audio data is encoded into packets via a codec like OPUS.
That packet then traverses multiple hops, potentially going over WiFi, Ethernet, 4G, fiber, satellites, etc.
It switches between different cell towers, routers, ISPs, transit providers, business units, and who knows what else.
Until finally, finally, the packet reaches ur Mom's iPhone and my words replay into her ear.
Tell her I miss her. 😢

Unfortunately, each of those hops have different properties and packet loss scenarios.
Many of them already have FEC built-in or don't need it at all.

By performing FEC in the application layer, specifically the audio codec, we're making a decision that's **end-to-end**.
It's suboptimal by definition because packet loss is a **hop-by-hop** property.

## Hop-by-Hop
If not the audio codec, where should we perform FEC instead?

In my ideal world, each hop uses a tailored loss recovery mechanism.
This is based on the properties of the hop, and if they expect:
- **burst loss**: delayed parity.
- **random loss**: interleaved parity.
- **low RTT**: retransmit packets.
- **congestion**: drop packets.

But at which layer?
A protocol like WiFi doesn't know the contents of each packet, especially if they're encrypted like every modern protocol.
Throughput matters when you're downloading a movie, but latency matters when you're on a conference call.

Our time-sensitive audio packets need to have different behavior than other traffic.
There are ways to signal [QoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service) in IP packets, but unfortunately, support is limited as is the granularity.
All it takes is one router in the chain to ignore your flag and everything falls apart.

That's why it absolutely makes sense to perform FEC at a higher level.
If the transport layer knows the desired properties, then it can make the best decision.
Not the audio codec.

## QUIC
So I just dunked on FEC in OPUS.
"Don't do FEC in the audio codec, do it in QUIC instead."

Well QUIC doesn't support FEC yet.
Oops.
There are [some proposals](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-michel-quic-fec-01.html) but I imagine it will be a long time before anything materializes.

QUIC is primarily designed and used by CDN companies.
Their whole purpose is to put edge nodes as close to the user as possible in order to improve the user experience.
When your RTT to the Google/CloudFlare/Akamai/Fastly/etc edge is 20ms, then FEC is strictly worse than retransmissions.
FEC can only ever be an improvement when `target_latency < 2*RTT`.

Additionally, there might not even be a need for FEC in QUIC.
WebRTC supports [RED](https://webrtchacks.com/red-improving-audio-quality-with-redundancy/) which was [added to RTP in 1997](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2198).
Why send parity data when you can just transmit the same packet multiple times?
It's wasteful but it's simple.

RED actually works natively in QUIC without any extensions.
A QUIC library can send redundant [STREAM frames](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-stream-frames) and the receiver will transparently discard duplicates.
This might just be good enough?

## Conclusion
Audio is important. <br />
Networks are complicated.<br />
This is not haiku.

FEC should not be in an audio codec, but rather closer to the source of packet loss.
But at the end of the day, I'm just shoving blame down the stack.
Do what works best for your users at whatever layer you control.

Just please, never show me a graph based on random packet loss again.
