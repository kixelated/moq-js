# Fork

The IETF process is a long burn.
I've flown out to 8 in-person meetings, attended at least 30 remote meetings, left hundreds of comments on issues/PRs, and even authored the original transport draft.
I have spent so much of my limited time on this planet working on this endeavor.

Unfortunately, this is the end of my involvement.
I don't think the [MoQ working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/) will produce anything useful.

## Why

The core MoQ group consists of 5 people from Cisco and ~5 people from CDN companies.
The focus has unsurprisingly been on layer that Cisco will use and CDNs will sell to them: [MoqTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/).

The unfortunate side effect of this dynamic is that the media layer (the M in MoQ) is an after-thought.
There's interest in standardizing _something_ but nobody intends to implement it as far as I can tell.
So instead the transport is molded around Cisco's proprietary media stack and their bizarre requirements.
And they have some bizarre requirements.

A concrete example: **sequential IDs**.
Every sane internet transport over lossy networks use sequential IDs: TCP, RTP, QUIC, etc.
The idea is that receiver can detect gaps caused by loss, and vice-versa knows when it has all of the data without blocking or querying the source.
But no, the Cisco folks insist that we MUST support both explicit and implicit gaps without specifying a reason.
It's the transport equivalent of arguing for both `null` and `undefined` in Javascript.

This may seem like a trivial transport detail, but it's one of many infuriating debates that have lasted years and will never be resolved while the current WG dynamics exist.
They don't need to compromise or back down on any position.

The result thus far can only be described as _obtuse_.
When a user joins the Discord server and asks how to use MoQ, I don't have a good answer.
"it depends" or "you have to do it yourself" or "we were thinking something like".
I can point to the [latest draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-06.html) but it raises more questions than it answers.
The protocol has become so abstracted, vague, and yet offers few concrete properties or functionality.

And to be clear, this isn't entirely Cisco's fault.
These individuals have the right intentions and of them are brilliant (shoutout to Cullen, Mo, Christian).
However, the power dynamics in the MoQ working group are broken until there are other stakeholders who actually care about media.

## What Now

I still love the idea of using QUIC to deliver media.
Suddenly WebRTC is no longer a requirement when WebCodecs and WebTransport are combined..
And I also love the concept behind MoqTransport:
A generic transport for media-like applications, fixing many of the scaling issues with WebRTC.

To this end, I've created:

-   🍴[MoqTransfork](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lcurley-moq-transfork/): A simple way to transport media-like content without a specific encoding.
-   🎏 **Karp**: A thin layer on top of MoqTransfork with functionality similar to HLS/DASH/WebRTC.

Why two protocols?
So relays/CDNs can implement MoqTransfork while media applications (ex. VLC/OBS) also implement Karp.

I swear there used to be [fork emoji](https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/16eq2nx/fork_emoji/).

## New Release

I've been working on this hard fork for a while in my limited free time.
It's become a grab-bag of new features all getting merged at the same time.

-   [Experimental WASM player](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-wasm)
-   New clustering protocol (using MoqTransfork!)
-   CMAF -> Karp transmuxing
-   Broadcast discovery
-   Simpler (but more powerful) API

And let's not forget the existing features that have been migrated over:

-   [Rust library](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs)
-   [Typescript library](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js) (web)
-   [Gstreamer plugin](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-gst)
-   [ffmpeg integration](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/tree/main/moq-pub)
-   [Relay server](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/tree/main/moq-relay)
-   [GCP infrastructure](https://github.com/kixelated/quic.video/tree/main/infra)

And yes, this is a hard fork.
If you want to stick with the IETF standard, that's fine but you gotta hit the fork button too.

## What's Next

I'm going to continue investing all of my free time (and hopefully some of my professional time) into MoQ.
But the time that would have been spent arguing to be better spent actually implementing cool shit.

I would highly encourage that anyone else do the same.
If you're an individual, startup, or a massive company alike, I would recommend that you make your own Media over QUIC implementation.
The "standard" will take 3-5 years at best even if you ignore these red flags, so just use the available tech today instead.

You can always hit [me](https://github.com/kixelated) up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr) if you want to use MoQ and more advice.
I can't promise that it will be good advice though.
