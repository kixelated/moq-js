**Media over QUIC** is new live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement designed for [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) as a new standard.

<p class="tagline">This is a proof-of-concept demo</p>

Everything is a work in progress, but some features include:

-   Web support via [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport) and [WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API)
-   CDN support via [MoqTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/).
-   Native support with ffmpeg and OBS plugins. **(in development)**

<p class="tagline">Try it out! [Watch](/watch) or [Publish](/publish) a broadcast</p>

This website is a fully [open source](/source).
The native components are in [Rust](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs) and the web components are in [Typescript](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js).

We are designing a protocol that is simple and yet flexible enough to support the wide range of use-cases:
from ultra-low latency to ultra-high quality, 1 viewer to 1 million viewers, and everything in
between. It's possible by evaluating the entire ecosystem and breaking the problem into layers:

-   **QUIC**: Responsible for networking.
-   **MoqTransport**: Responsible for CDN support (caching and fanout).
-   **Warp**: Responsible for media encoding.

MoQ is still very early in development and many features are missing.
Everything is liable to change, especially if you get involved!

<p class="tagline">Check out the current [Issues](/issues) and **Roadmap**</p>

The protocol is being developed by the
[IETF MoQ working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/). The
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) is an open organization that develops Internet standards, including
some of your _favorite_ protocols like HTTP, TLS, and DNS.

**Note:** This is not an official IETF website, nor does the MoQ working group endorse this website.
We are active participants, but the standard is being produced by many individuals from many companies.
