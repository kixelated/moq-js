**Media over QUIC** is a live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement designed for [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) and individuals from your _favorite_ big tech companies.

This website is a proof-of-concept using a minimal [fork](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lcurley-moq-transfork/) of the protocol.
Some features include:

-   Web support via [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport) and [WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API)
-   CDN support via [MoqTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/).
-   Rust and Typescript libraries.
-   ffmpeg and gstreamer integration.

<p class="tagline">Fully [open source](/source) demo and library</p>

The native components are in [Rust](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs) and the web components are (currently) in [Typescript](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js).

The protocol is being developed by the
[IETF MoQ working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/). The
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) is an open organization that develops Internet standards, including
some of your _favorite_ protocols like HTTP, TLS, and DNS.

We are designing a protocol that is simple and yet flexible enough to support the wide range of use-cases:
from ultra-low latency to ultra-high quality, 1 viewer to 1 million viewers, contribution and distribution, and everything in between.
See the [motivation](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-01.html#name-motivation) for more information.

**Note:** This is not an official IETF website, nor does the MoQ working group endorse this website.
The standard is being produced by many individuals from companies such as Google, Meta, Cisco, Akamai, etc.
