### NOTE

You can use [moq-pub](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs) to publish from CLI instead:

```bash
# Must be unique
NAME="my-broadcast"

# See the README for a full list of ffmpeg arguments required
ffmpeg -f mp4 - | moq-pub https://relay.quic.video/${NAME}

# Watch it at: https://quic.video/watch/${NAME}
```
