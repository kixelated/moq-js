# Issues

Yeah so there's a lot of work to do.

This is an early PoC and hobby project, so expect nothing to work. Check out the Github issues
for [moq-rs](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues) and
[moq-js](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues) if you want to contribute or complain.

## Browser Support

We're using some pretty new web standards so browser support is limited. Here is a
non-compreshensive list of the required features from the [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) database
as of: todo

The only hard requirement is
[WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport). See the following
sections for possible alternatives for web playback and web contribution.

## Web Playback

[WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) decoding is a breeze but
rendering is a nightmare, as the application is responsible for everything. This includes when to
render video frames but also when to emit audio samples, which gets very complicated quickly as it
involves synchronization.

Additionally, there's no built-in controls. Even something as trivial as changing the volume
requires building a WebAudio filter as opposed to relying on the `<video>` tag. I'm not a front-end
developer (no flame pls) and would love any contributions on this front.

A much simpler rendering technology is
[MSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API). I had a
previous demo that used this API, but the latency is significantly higher than WebCodecs as it will
buffer during starvation. I plan on supporting it again in the future and it works great with Media
over QUIC as both use fMP4.

## Web Contribution

[WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) is great for encoding in
my relatively limited experience. We may need some more functionality to support conferencing, such
as like echo cancellation or advanced encodings.

The main limitation is capturing sources from the browser, as the browser doesn't have the same
flexibility as a native program like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). I would also love to see a UI
that allows positioning elements or doing cool effects. If you can render to a `<canvas>` then you
can encode it with WebCodecs and transmit it with WebTransport.

Media over QUIC relies on both congestion control and prioritization to provide the best user
experience on poor networks. The WebTransport specification does support
[prioritization](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportsendstreamoptions-sendorder)
and
[congestion control hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransport-congestioncontrol),
but these are simple and have not been implemented yet. We have limited control over the browser's
congestion control which is especially important for live media.

## Congestion Control

-   [moq-rs](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs) uses an experimental
    [BBR implementation](https://docs.rs/quinn/latest/quinn/congestion/struct.Bbr.html/)
-   [moq-js](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js) uses whatever the browser implements, which
    defaults to [New Reno](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-recovery).

The congestion control algorithm is extremely important for live media over the internet, as
[bufferbloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat) will cause queuing on the network.
TCP-oriented congestion control are often compared by sustained throughput, but for live media we're
more interested in latency, since the encoded bitrate is the limiting factor. When latency is
critical, it's better to drop old media instead of queuing new media, and that's only possible when
you can detect queuing via congestion control.

#### Loss-based

Loss-based congestion control like [New Reno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control)
(Windows default) and [CUBIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUBIC_TCP) (Linux default) suffer from
bufferbloat. Your experience will vary based on the network, with some ISPs and parts of the world
being significantly worse than others. This is also the fundamental issue with RTMP, since it relies
on the operating system's TCP congestion control. QUIC libraries can ship their own congestion
control allowing much faster experimentation and iteration.

#### Delay-based

Delay-based congestion control like
[BBR](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/97/slides/slides-97-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control-02.pdf) and
[COPA](https://web.mit.edu/copa/) are better, but are still designed for TCP. They're not designed
for application-limited environments like live media where we don't fully saturate the network.
Flooding the network with PADDING packets to occasionally saturate the network makes a big
difference, but is experimental and not yet implemented.

#### Jitter-based

Jitter-based congestion control like
[GCC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-rmcat-gcc-02) and
[SCReAM](https://github.com/EricssonResearch/scream) are the best\* for real-time media and see wide
usage in WebRTC. However, the per-packet feedback required for these algorithms are not available in
QUIC. We will need a QUIC extension in order to match WebRTC performance and latency.

## Dynamic Bitrate

An alternative to dropping media is to dynamically adjust the bitrate. The picture quality will
worsen, but more frames will be delivered, which often results in a better user experience.

#### 1:1

In 1:1 video conferencing, the media encoding is adjusted in response to viewer feedback. A protocol
like WebRTC will lower the media bitrate in response to minor congestion and request a new I-frame
in response to major-congestion. No such feedback exists yet in Media over QUIC, and is complicated
by the presence of relays.

In 1:N video conferencing, the encoding is fixed, as one viewer's experience should not degrade
everybody else's experience. The common approach is to encode multiple renditions of the broadcast
at different bitrates, allowing the viewer to switch between them depending on their network. This
is called [ABR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming) in distribution circles
and [simulcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulcast) in contribution circles. This is not
implemented yet either.

## CDNs

Media over QUIC is designed with relays and CDNs in mind.
[MoqTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/) is media agnostic and
exposes only the most critical information to relay. The design should enable world-side scale while
still supporting real-time latency budgets.

...but we haven't built it yet. You're currently connecting to a single server somewhere in the US,
so don't expect the best quality. I'm working on it now so expect this section to be updated soon.

## Specification

Media over QUIC is an [IETF working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/). The
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) is an open organization that develops Internet standards, including
some of your _favorite_ protocols like HTTP, TLS, and DNS.

The standardization effort is slow and deliberate so don't expect an RFC for years.
[quic.video](https://quic.video) uses a fork of the specification, allowing us to experiment with
new features without the litigation involved in a standard.

[Here's a list](https://docs.rs/moq-transport/latest/moq_transport/setup/struct.Version.html#associatedconstant.KIXEL_00)
of the changes thus far, which we hope will be merged into the standard.
